**Project Description**

Share-it is a web application built using Spring Framework, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, Lombok, Java 8 Date/Time API, Java Validation API, Maven, JUnit, and PostgreSQL.

**Idea**

The project aims to provide users with a platform to share items and rent them for a specified duration. It facilitates users in sharing their belongings and finding items they need for temporary use.

**Key Features:**

1. **Item Sharing:** Users can share items they are willing to lend to others.

2. **Item Rental:** Users can search for items they need and rent them for a specified period.

3. **Reservation Management:** The service allows users to reserve items for specific dates and also restrict access to the item during the reservation period to prevent overlapping bookings.

4. **Request System:** If a desired item is not available on the platform, users can submit requests. Administrators can then review these requests and add new items for sharing based on user demand.

5. **Dynamic Inventory:** The platform dynamically updates its inventory based on user interactions, ensuring a diverse range of items available for sharing.

Share-it enhances user collaboration by promoting a sharing economy model, allowing individuals to utilize resources efficiently and reduce consumption. It offers a seamless experience for users to share, rent, and manage items, fostering a community-driven approach to resource utilization.
